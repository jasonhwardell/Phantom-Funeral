This is the place for the triflings of Phantom Funeral Press, an illusory imprint from the remains of Dayton, Ohio, USA.

The site design and implementation is whole-hog lifted from [Michael Lombardi's Platen Template](https://github.com/platenio/platen-template). It's a good design and I like it a lot.

As of November 2022, I've completed the web version of the following projects:
- [The Dungeon Near the Shadow](/games/adventures/tdnts/) - a low-level horror adventure through world-ending blight
- [Immortal Festival](/games/adventures/if/) - a side-quest scenario of godly powers, mortal tasks
- [Blade in Thrall to the Lorekeeper](/games/things/blade/) - a dream I had about a dream about a writer
- [LampCorp: a Business Card TTRPG](/games/things/lamp/) - a minuscule corporate blandscape ttrpg
- [Out of the Blue](/games/adventures/ootb/) - a teeny-tiny planetary hexcrawl for Into the Black 

I also make some dungeon-worthy music as [In the Vast Forest](https://inthevastforest.bandcamp.com/). Check out my contribution to [Heimat Der Katastrophe's](https://heimatderkatastrophe.bandcamp.com/) Dungeon Synth Magazine below!
