This is the place for the triflings of Phantom Funeral Press, an illusory imprint from the remains of Dayton, Ohio, USA.

The site design and implementation is whole-hog lifted from [Michael Lombardi's Platen Template](https://github.com/platenio/platen-template). It's a good design and I like it a lot.

As of March 2023, my newest adventure: [STONES TO KILL THE SEA](/games/adventures/stkts/) is live and ready for your enjoyment. Additionally, print copies of [KOBOLDS. IN THE EQUIPMENT GRAVEYARD](/games/adventures/kiteg/) are on their way and will soon be available with at least two of your favorite TTRPG retailers!  

I also make some dungeon-worthy music as [In the Vast Forest](https://inthevastforest.bandcamp.com/). Check out my soundtrack for Andrew Orvedahl's brilliant game [DUSTER](https://www.occupiedhex.com/duster) below.
