This is the place for the triflings of Phantom Funeral Press, an illusory imprint from the remains of Dayton, Ohio, USA. Browse adventures, shorter things, and blogs just over there on the menu. You can do it!

The site design and implementation is whole-hog lifted from [Michael Lombardi's Platen Template](https://github.com/platenio/platen-template). It's a good design and I like it a lot.
