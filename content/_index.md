This is the place for the triflings of Phantom Funeral Press, an illusory imprint from the remains of Dayton, Ohio, USA.

The site design and implementation is whole-hog lifted from [Michael Lombardi's Platen Template](https://github.com/platenio/platen-template). It's a good design and I like it a lot.

As of May 2023, my newest adventure: [THE DUNGEON NEAR THE SHADOW: BASTARDIZED EDITION](https://jasonwardell.itch.io/the-dungeon-near-the-shadow-bastards-edition) is available to purchase digitally. It's also the first item in my brand new [Phantom Funeral Webstore](https://store.phantomfuneral.com/)! 

[STONES TO KILL THE SEA](/games/adventures/stkts/) will be joining it in print shortly and print copies of [KOBOLDS. IN THE EQUIPMENT GRAVEYARD](/games/adventures/kiteg/) are currently available at [Spear Witch](https://spearwitch.com/products/kobolds-in-the-equipment-graveyard) in the US and [Monkey's Paw Games](https://monkeyspawgames.com/en-us/products/kobolds-in-the-equipment-graveyard) in Canada!  

I also make some dungeon-worthy music as [In the Vast Forest](https://inthevastforest.bandcamp.com/). Check out my soundtrack for Andrew Orvedahl's brilliant game [DUSTER](https://www.occupiedhex.com/duster) below.
