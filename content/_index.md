This is the place for the triflings of Phantom Funeral Press, an illusory imprint from the remains of Dayton, Ohio, USA.

The site design and implementation is whole-hog lifted from [Michael Lombardi's Platen Template](https://github.com/platenio/platen-template). It's a good design and I like it a lot.

If patterns of behavior prove true, I'll maybe update this one or two more times before abandoning it for good, but it was nice while it lasted. Almost everything I'm writing these days is in Markdown, though, so who knows! 

Also, there can be music:
