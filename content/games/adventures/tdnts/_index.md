## Introduction
The persistent suborbital occlusion sits writhing in the west. It dropped from the heavens, some say, or maybe it bubbled out of the ground or burst out of the space between air, three years past. Some call it the *Shadow* for how it negates the light, drowning everything it covers in opaque darkness. 

The sun no longer sets in the west: it disappears into the Shadow, and each evening you can hear prayers at every hearth that it returns unchanged the next day. Most things that enter the shadow do not return, and if they do, they are seldom unchanged.

**THE DUNGEON NEAR THE SHADOW** is a low-level horror-flavored adventure for the tabletop role-playing game of your choice. It refers to many standard elements across simple systems—hit dice, armor value, saves—but if your system does not use these mechanics, you should find a suitable substitute that maintains a vibe of _creepy, weird, & dangerous._

When it comes our time to change, may we be led caringly into that terrifying unknown, and may we learn to do the same for those who come after.

## Krotak
The town of **Krotak** is the last town before the shadow overtakes the western lands. Despite its proximity to the cursed occlusion, it is a thriving and peaceful place. When the shadow emerged, it wholly enveloped the seat of power for the Tyrant King Lyrica,^[b. Lyrica Marian Elea V, 454-532(?), a cowardly and power-hungry man. His kingdom collapsed at the first sign of danger, and he holed himself up in his tower. Presumably dead.] effectively liberating the fertile farmlands at the outskirts of his domain. The farmers and tradespeople who were so commonly subjected to his cruelty built up Krotak as an independent community, and it has blossomed into a tight-knit and self-sustaining settlement.

Arriving, perhaps to investigate the utter collapse of a powerful continent-spanning empire, perhaps out of curiosity for the supernatural occurrence that effected it, one finds Krotak to be an insular community. Outsiders are greeted with thinly-veiled suspicion and a bare minimum of hospitality.

### Townsfolk
<img align="right" width=125 src="cassidy.png">  

1. **Cassidy** (she/her) - 3HD, 6AC, Longsword  
A stern, towering former soldier of the Tyrant King, now serving as a blacksmith's apprentice. She defected when the Shadow emerged, abandoning her assigned post at the dungeon situated just outside of the occlusion. She is mournful for former comrades who chose to remain loyal.  
  
_"We weren't all bad. Some of us strove to make things better... Not all of them deserved to die. Many did, but not all. I should have done more to help."_

<img align="right" width=125 src="anemone.png">  

2. **Anemone** (she/them) - 1HD, 2AC, Spellbook containing _Web_, _Sleep_, and _Detect Magic_.  
An ageless, always-smiling merchant who claims to have a trade route through the lands under Shadow. She notes with grim sincerity that it takes one week by horse to clear, past the abandoned kingdom, and out to the coast and blessed light.  
  
_"There are some in there... wouldn't call 'em people anymore. They don't want for traditional wares. Sorry wretches; best to leave 'em be and keep moving."_

<img align="right" width=125 src="graham.png">  

3. **Graham** (he/them) - 2HD, 4AC, Holy Symbol, _Cure Light Wounds_, _Purify Food and Drink_.  
A hunched and rosy-cheeked former healer, who trekked into the Shadow in the early days to recover survivors. Returned alone after a week and hasn't left the tavern since. They don't talk about it, only drink, but welcome company while doing so.  
 
 _"Another."_

<img align="right" width=125 src="ashen.png">  

4. **Ashen** (he/him) - 3HD, 2AC, Noxious Censer, _Speak with Fungi_.  
A doomsday prophet who draws a small audience every day in Krotak town square. He claims to speak on behalf of the Shadow, promising that the Tyrant King's fall was just the beginning, and soon the world entire will be enveloped. He is capable of speaking with the Changed.

_"The time is at hand when you—all of you—will account and live eternally in pain and suffering under the great cleansing darkness!"_

<img align="right" width=125 src="karin.png">  

5. **Karin** (they/them) - 3HD, 4AC, Sickle, Spear  
A tanned, middle-aged farmhand, who used to have a large tract of family land that is now fully encompassed by the Shadow. They have nightmares of a beast with the face of the former King prowling the borderlands.

_"Having that warmongering despot on our door was miserable. I try to not think about it; we're better off now in nearly every way."_

<img align="right" width=125 src="bert.png">  

6. **Bert** (she/her) - 2HD, 2AC, Cudgel, Good Booze  
A lean, barb-tongued tavern owner who is furious at having a family heirloom—a floral locket—stolen amid a recent wave of burglaries. She knows everyone in town and is looking for excuses to pin the crime on someone.

_"See where you get when you cross your barkeep. See where you get."_

### Other Rumors
1. **False** - _"Tonight, keep an ear to the west. There've been heavy drums almost every night—war drums, I reckon. Listen, and you'll hear them!"_
2. **False** - _"I swear that shadow has been blooming and stretching. Just the other day, it was sprouting arms and I'm sure it would've caught me if I didn't hightail it."_
3. **False** - _"The Tyrant King is alive and heading for Krotak! He's got a whole regiment in the dungeon and it's only a matter of time before we're subjects again—or worse."_
4. **True** - _"A week back, I saw a flicker of light at the mouth of that damn dungeon. Spooked my horse good, and me, too, if we're being honest. Haven't seen it since, though."_
5. **True** - _"Those people, those changed things in the Shadow look creepy, but they're harmless. Mostly eat bugs and moss to survive, too weak to hunt or scavenge anything else."_
6. **True** - _"The Shadow is toxic in a way, y'know. Contagious. Spend too long in it, and you'll change, too."_

## Shadow
The pulsing miasma of Shadow looms at the edge of the landscape west of Krotak. From the fields and pasture surrounding the town, it is as a smooth grey-black stone placed atop the land. At the perimeter, there is a small weather-beaten stone structure, half-covered in Shadow: the entrance to the dungeon.

The air is noticeably thicker in the Shadow. Humid and stale, there is a substance one can feel on the skin, in the eyes, in the lungs. Upon coming into contact with it, and for every Watch spent within, a character must Save against its contagious and corrupting effects. Following three consecutive failed Saves, the irreversible Change begins:

| # | Effect by Number of Failed Saves                                                                                                                                             |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 | It's a little easier to see in the dark, a little harder to tolerate bright lights.                                                                                       |
| 4 | Any light causes pain and confusion, all attributes, attacks, and saves are at -2 outside of the Shadow.                                                                  |
| 5 | You will do anything you can to avoid light and become violent when faced with it. Attributes, attacks, saves at -5 outside Shadow.                                       |
| 6 | Your skin takes a pale, translucent tone, your hair thins, you stop eating and drinking. Grit can no longer be recovered by any means.                                    |
| 7 | Exposure to light causes 1 Flesh damage per turn. You can smell edible fungus and moss, and are drawn to it.                                                              |
| 8 | You are too weak to stand, think, or weep, but you cannot die unaided. Even if exposed to light for a prolonged time, you will only howl in unnatural pain but never die. |
