## Introduction
The persistent suborbital occlusion sits writhing in the west. It dropped from the heavens, some say, or maybe it bubbled out of the ground or burst out of the space between air, three years past. Some call it the *Shadow* for how it negates the light, drowning everything it covers in opaque darkness. 

The sun no longer sets in the west: it disappears into the Shadow, and each evening you can hear prayers at every hearth that it returns unchanged the next day. Most things that enter the shadow do not return, and if they do, they are seldom unchanged.

**THE DUNGEON NEAR THE SHADOW** is a low-level horror-flavored adventure for the tabletop role-playing game of your choice. It refers to many standard elements across simple systems—hit dice, armor value, saves—but if your system does not use these mechanics, you should find a suitable substitute that maintains a vibe of _creepy, weird, & dangerous._

When it comes our time to change, may we be led caringly into that terrifying unknown, and may we learn to do the same for those who come after.

## Krotak
The town of **Krotak** is the last town before the shadow overtakes the western lands. Despite its proximity to the cursed occlusion, it is a thriving and peaceful place. When the shadow emerged, it wholly enveloped the seat of power for the Tyrant King Lyrica,^[b. Lyrica Marian Elea V, 454-532(?), a cowardly and power-hungry man. His kingdom collapsed at the first sign of danger, and he holed himself up in his tower. Presumably dead.] effectively liberating the fertile farmlands at the outskirts of his domain. The farmers and tradespeople who were so commonly subjected to his cruelty built up Krotak as an independent community, and it has blossomed into a tight-knit and self-sustaining settlement.

Arriving, perhaps to investigate the utter collapse of a powerful continent-spanning empire, perhaps out of curiosity for the supernatural occurrence that effected it, one finds Krotak to be an insular community. Outsiders are greeted with thinly-veiled suspicion and a bare minimum of hospitality.

### Townsfolk
<img align="right" width=125 src="cassidy.png">  
1. **Cassidy** (she/her) - 3HD, 6AC, Longsword  
A stern, towering former soldier of the Tyrant King, now serving as a blacksmith's apprentice. She defected when the Shadow emerged, abandoning her assigned post at the dungeon situated just outside of the occlusion. She is mournful for former comrades who chose to remain loyal.  
  
_"We weren't all bad. Some of us strove to make things better... Not all of them deserved to die. Many did, but not all. I should have done more to help."_

2. **Anemone** (she/them) - 1HD, 2AC, Spellbook containing _Web_, _Sleep_, and _Detect Magic_.  
An ageless, always-smiling merchant who claims to have a trade route through the lands under Shadow. She notes with grim sincerity that it takes one week by horse to clear, past the abandoned kingdom, and out to the coast and blessed light.  
  
_"There are some in there... wouldn't call 'em people anymore. They don't want for traditional wares. Sorry wretches; best to leave 'em be and keep moving."_

3. **Graham** (he/them) - 2HD, 4AC, Holy Symbol, _Cure Light Wounds_, _Purify Food and Drink_.  
A hunched and rosy-cheeked former healer, who trekked into the Shadow in the early days to recover survivors. Returned alone after a week and hasn't left the tavern since. They don't talk about it, only drink, but welcome company while doing so.  
  
_"Another."_
